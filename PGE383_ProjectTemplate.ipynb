    "#### General Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "For your final project, I'm expecting an **educational product** that could be handed to a student and they could quickly learn a new machine learning concept. While developing your final projects, ask yourself, 'could someone new to machine learning understand my workflow?'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* this is a win-win since it is an opportunity to you to dive deeper and explore a concepted related to a machine learning algorithm and is good practice for communicating machine learning with others (something that you will need to do at work)\n",
    "\n",
    "* this is an opportunity to apply course learnings and demonstrate a high level of proficiency. I will post workflows online in my GitHub repository and use to support future classes and with your authorship to promote your data science skills.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expectations for Your Well-documented Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "* **flow** include a consistent narrative,\n",
    "\n",
    "    * no 2 code blocks should be adjacent, always have a short statement to explain, connect to the next code block\n",
    "      \n",
    "    * ask a question, produce results to answer the question, discuss your results, repeat...\n",
    "\n",
    "* **concise** be as concise as possible,\n",
    "\n",
    "    * use point form (except for the executive summary)\n",
    "      \n",
    "    * use effective, creative figures that combine what could have been in multiple plots onto a single plot when possible\n",
    "      \n",
    "    * every line of code, statment or figure must have purpose\n",
    "      \n",
    "    * conciseness is part of the grading, don't add content that isn't needed\n",
    "      \n",
    "    * aim for 4-7 pages of Jupyter notebook\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **very clear** descriptions and visualizations,\n",
    "\n",
    "    * great executive summary\n",
    "      \n",
    "    * label every axis\n",
    "      \n",
    "    * use readable code, logical variable names, use available functionality for compactness\n",
    " \n",
    "* **comprehensive** treatments of your topic,\n",
    "\n",
    "    * deep dive for complete treatment of a topic, include the theory, common practice, and experiment that demonstrates and tests the topic\n",
    "      \n",
    "    * carefully choose a topic scope so that you can be concise and comprehensive for your topic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Data \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some guidelines on using data,\n",
    "\n",
    "* **case studies are not allowed**, if you can pose your project as, 'can I build a machine learning model with my data?', then don't do this. Your project must answer a specific question about machine learning, i.e., focus on a concept from machine learning and not the data. If in doubt, review your topic with Dr. Pyrcz\n",
    "\n",
    "* **data must be public**, if while focussing on machine learning concepts you want to use data, then that data must be public domain so that your worrkflow can be posted online with data the linked for others to run (i.e., repeatability). Confidential data is not allowed even with permission from the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **synthetic data**, is generally better as it can be designed for the investigation, tuned to different levels of difficulty, randomized to demonstrate results in expectation, and the truth is known so there are not issues related with interpretation. Dr. Pyrcz has syntehtic datasets and workflows for making synthetic data in his [GeoDataSets](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeoDataSets) repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Using Code From Others\n",
    "  \n",
    "You may use blocks/snipets of code from other sources with citation. To cite a set of code separate in a block and do this in the markdown above the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code block is from Professor Michael Pyrcz (@GeostatsGuy), SubSurfuceDataAnalytics_PCA.ipynb from [GeostatsGuy GitHub](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/PythonNumericalDemos/blob/master/SubsurfaceDataAnalytics_PCA.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "# load the variogram\n",
    "    nst = vario['nst']; pmx = 9999.9\n",
    "    cc = np.zeros(nst); aa = np.zeros(nst); it = np.zeros(nst)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or use inline citations such as this for a few of lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def simple_simple_krige(df,xcol,ycol,vcol,dfl,xlcol,ylcol,vario,skmean): # function from Professor Michael Pyrcz,https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/PythonNumericalDemos/blob/master/SubsurfaceDataAnalytics_PCA.ipynb \n",
