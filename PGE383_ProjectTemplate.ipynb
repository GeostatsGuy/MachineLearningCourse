    "\n",
    "I'm expecting an **educational product** that could be handed to a student and they could quickly learn a new concept. Ask yourself, could someone new to machine learning understand my workflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "* this is a win-win since it is  an opportunity to you to dive deeper and explore a concepted related to a machine learning algorithm and is good practice for communicating machine learning with others (something that you will have to do at work)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expectations for Your Well-documented Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "* **flow** include a consistent narrative, e.g., no 2 code blocks should be adjacent, always have a short statement to explain, connect to the next code block\n",
    "\n",
    "* **concise** be as concise as possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * use point form (except for the executive summary) \n",
    "    * use effective, creative figures that combine what could have been in multiple plots onto a single plot when possible\n",
    "    * every line of code, statment or figure must have purpose\n",
    "    * conciseness is part of the grading, don't add content that isn't needed\n",
    "    * aim for 4-5 pages of Jupyter notebook\n",
    "    \n",
    "* be very clear\n",
    "\n",
    "    * great executive summary\n",
    "    * label every axis\n",
    "    * use readable code, logical variable names, use available functionality for compactness\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Using Code From Others\n",
