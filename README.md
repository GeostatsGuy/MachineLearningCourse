## Subsurface Machine Learning Graduate Course 

### Professor Michael J. Pyrcz, The University of Texas at Austin

This is the repository for my machine learning course's **final course projects**. 

#### Machine Learning Projects

As part of this graduate level machine learning course, all students complete a machine learning final course project. 

The challenge: build a well-documented, educational machine learning workflow.

Here's the motivation and more details:

* **produce a comprehensive, concise, well-documented, machine learning workflow in a Jupyter Notebook** - an opportunity to apply course learnings and demonstrate a high level of proficiency.

* **open-source** - contributions to GitHub are recognized in many companies. I'm introducing my students to the benefits of contributing to open-source development, including to build up their CVs.

* **workflows with educational content** - my students will develop new data science workflows in their careers, but for their workflows to be deployed and adopted they will have to teach the concepts to their peers. I'm introducing the behavoir of educating while deploying.

* **going beyond course content** - while I can teach the theory and share examples, expertise in machine learning requires diving into each method and gaining experience with all the components, assumptions and limitations. This is required as a competent engineer or scientist!

* **To assist my students**, I have provided a [project template](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/MachineLearningCourse/blob/main/PGE383_ProjectTemplate.ipynb).

With permission, I post the workflows online in this GitHub repository and use it to support future classes (with credit to the original authors).

* the workflows are graded by the following criteria:

| Element                | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Great Executive Summary | Gap, Work to Address Gap, Learnings and Recommendation |
| Workflow Steps          |  All Aligned with Goal                                                                                                    |
| Concise Workflow        | Every Step and Figure has a Purpose / Consistent with Provided Template / Features Briefly Explained / Feature have Units |
| Images / Figures         | Excellent Figures / Subplots and Combined Plots for Efficient Displays and Communication / Axes Labeled / Consistent Figure Sizes |
| Demonstrated Knowledge  | All Modeling Choices Defended / Demonstrated Extension of Knowledge                                                               | 
| Readable Code           | Code Documentation / Steps’ Description and Observations between Code Blocks / Only Include Needed Packages / Use Function for Concise Code |
| Citations               | All Code from Others Cited                                                                                                        |
| Creativity / Innovation | Unique, Novel Application of Machine Learning                                                                                     |

#### This is Going to Be Fun

I hope you join us in my PGE 383: Subsurface Modeling class. We have about 40 graduate students from engineering and geoscience participating here at the University of Texas at Austin. The Jackson School of Geosciences offered a new classroom in their building after we outgrew our room in the Petroleum and Geosystems engineering department. I appreciate the excellent support from both the Hidebrand Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering and the Jackson School of Geosciences.

#### Want to Work Together?

I hope that this is helpful to those that want to learn more about subsurface modeling, data analytics and machine learning. Students and working professionals are welcome to participate.

* Want to invite me to visit your company for training, mentoring, project review, workflow design and consulting, I'd be happy to drop by and work with you! 

* Interested in partnering, supporting my graduate student research or my Subsurface Data Analytics and Machine Learning consortium (co-PIs including Profs. Foster, Torres-Verdin and van Oort)? My research combines data analytics, stochastic modeling and machine learning theory with practice to develop novel methods and workflows to add value. We are solving challenging subsurface problems!
